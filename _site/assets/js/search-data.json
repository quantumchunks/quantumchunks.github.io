The negative of a complex number is obtained by negating the real and imaginary parts individually. \\[-z = -a - ib\\] Subtraction . Subtracting two complex numbers \\(z_1 - z_2\\) is equal to adding the first one to the negative of the second one \\(z_1 + (-z_2)\\). \\[z_1 - z_2 = (a - c) + i(b - d)\\] Multiplication . ",

By definition the magnitude (or norm) of a complex vector \\(\\|\\psi\\|\\) is equal to the square root of its inner product with its dual row vector. \\[\\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle \\psi | \\cdot | \\psi \\rangle}\\] The inner product \\(\\langle \\psi | \\cdot | \\psi \\rangle\\) is often abbreviated as \\(\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle\\). It is worth mentioning that the inner product is always defined between a bra and a ket. Hence, called bracket. We can write the inner product explicitly in terms of \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) . \\[\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1^* &amp; c_2^* \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix} = |c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2.\\] Again, the normalization dictates that \\(\\sqrt{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle}=1\\).
