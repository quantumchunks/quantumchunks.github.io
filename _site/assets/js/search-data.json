    "content": "Ehrenfest’s theorem bridges the gap between classical and quantum mechanics. It states that in quantum mechanics the expectation values obey classical laws. For example, the expectation values of position \\(\\langle x\\rangle\\) and momentum \\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) are related as follows . \\[\\langle p\\rangle = m\\frac{d\\langle x\\rangle}{dt}.\\] Or the Newton’s second law still works for the expectation value of momentum \\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) and force \\(\\langle -\\partial_xV\\rangle\\) where \\(V(x)\\) is the potential energy . \\[\\frac{d\\langle p\\rangle}{dt} = \\langle -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\rangle.\\] What is meant by an expectation value, you might ask. Assume a particle that behaves quantum mechanically. It has a wave function \\(\\psi(x)\\) that spreads over a region in space. The expectation value of its position, which is denoted by \\(\\langle x\\rangle\\) is a statistical measure. Before I tell you what \\(\\langle x\\rangle\\) means, I want to emphasize what it doesn’t. It does NOT mean the average position if you measure the position of the same particle over and over again. The reason is that the first time you measure the position of a particle its wave function collapses and the following measurements are not going to be independent. What the expectation value actually means is that if you had an ensemble of identically prepared particles (same initial wave function) and you measured their positions all at once and you took the average of those values, you’d get a number close to \\(\\langle x\\rangle\\). 1 .

    "content": "Proving Ehrenfest’s theorem is straightforward. It is an opportunity to practice our skills in integration by parts and the product formula for derivatives. First relation . To prove the first relation we need to take the definition of momentum operator \\(p = -i\\hbar\\partial_x\\) as given otherwise it would be a circular proof. Let’s start by taking the time derivative of \\(\\langle x\\rangle\\), . \\[\\frac{d\\langle x\\rangle}{dt} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} x |\\psi|^2 dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial t}\\psi + \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t}\\bigg)dx.\\] Using Schrodinger equation and its complex conjugate we can replace the time derivatives with second order spatial derivatives . \\[\\frac{d\\langle x\\rangle}{dt} = -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2m}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi^*}{\\partial x^2}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg)dx.\\] Adding and removing \\(\\partial_x\\psi^*\\partial_x\\psi\\) inside parentheses results in . \\[\\frac{d\\langle x\\rangle}{dt} = -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2m}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi^*}{\\partial x^2}\\psi + \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg)dx,\\] \\[= -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2m}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg)dx.\\] Integration by parts leads us to . \\[\\frac{d\\langle x\\rangle}{dt} = -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2m}\\bigg[x\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg)\\bigg|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\bigg(\\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg)dx\\bigg].\\] Assuming that the wave function decays at least as fast as \\(1/\\sqrt{|x|}\\), we can convince ourselves that the boundary term is zero. 2 Let’s do another integration by parts, this time on the first term inside the integral above. That gives us another boundary term which is zero and another integrand of the form \\(\\psi^*\\partial_x\\psi\\). Therefore, . \\[\\frac{d\\langle x\\rangle}{dt} = -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2m} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 2\\psi^*\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} dx.\\] Rearranging the variables we arrive at . \\[m\\frac{d\\langle x\\rangle}{dt} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi^*\\bigg(-i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigg)\\psi dx = \\langle p\\rangle.\\] Second relation .

Therefore, the second term in the integrand reduces to \\(\\psi^*(\\partial_xV)\\psi\\). Moreover, using integration by parts we can replace the \\(\\psi^*\\partial^3_x\\psi\\) term with . \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial^3 \\psi}{\\partial x^3} dx = \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2} dx.\\] The boundary term is zero as the wave function and its derivatives approach zero at infinity. Therefore, . \\[\\frac{d\\langle p\\rangle}{dt} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\bigg[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi^*}{\\partial x^2}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg) - \\psi^* \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\psi \\bigg] dx,\\] \\[\\frac{d\\langle p\\rangle}{dt} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\bigg[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_x}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg) - \\psi^* \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\psi \\bigg] dx.\\] The first term of the integrand becomes a boundary term after integration . \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_x}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg)dx = \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\bigg|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}=0\\] which amounts to zero as the wave function approaches zero at infinity. Finally we are left with . \\[\\frac{d\\langle p\\rangle}{dt} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi^* \\bigg(-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\bigg)\\psi dx = \\langle -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\rangle.\\] ",

We can write the inner product explicitly in terms of \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) . \\[\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1^* &amp; c_2^* \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix} = |c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2.\\] Again, the normalization dictates that \\(\\sqrt{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle}=1\\). In other words . \\[\\sqrt{|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2} = 1.\\] ",

A vector can have any number of elements. A vector with only one element is just a scalar (just a number). Column vs Row . There are two ways to list the elements of a vector. In a row . \\[\\bm{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\] or in a column . \\[\\bm{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0.5 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\] The row vector \\(\\bm{v}\\) and the column vector \\(\\bm{u}\\) are considered to be different. That is why I used two different letters to represent them. There is an operation that relates these two to each other. It’s called transpose and is shown by T in the superscript. \\[\\bm{v}^T = \\bm{u} \\\\ \\bm{u}^T = \\bm{v} \\\\\\] The transpose of a column vector is a row vector and vice versa. If you transpose a vector twice, you get the same vector. \\[(\\bm{v}^T)^T = \\bm{v}\\] Scalar multiplication . You can multiply a vector by a scalar (which is just a number). For that, you would just need to multiply individual elements of the vector by that same scalar. \\[a\\bm{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} -a \\\\ 0.5a \\\\ 3a \\end{pmatrix}\\] ",

    "content": "How do we know if the wave function stays normalized as it evolves in time? 1 . Solution The answer is in the Schrodinger equation which describes the time evolution of the wave function. Imagine a particle with the wave function \\(\\psi(x, t)\\) in a one-dimensional world with potential energy \\(V(x)\\). The Schrodinger equation for this particle is . \\[i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2} + V\\psi.\\] Now, let’s see what happens if we take the total derivative of the norm of the wave function \\(\\int\\vert\\psi\\vert^2 dx\\) with respect to time which is equivalent to . \\[\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\psi|^2 dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}|\\psi(x, t)|^2 dx.\\] Since \\(\\vert\\psi\\vert^2 = \\psi^*\\psi\\), we can use the product rule to write the integrand as . \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} |\\psi|^2 = \\frac{\\partial\\psi^*}{\\partial t}\\psi + \\psi^* \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t}.\\] From the Schrodinger equation and its complex conjugate we know . \\[i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2} + V\\psi,\\] \\[-i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi^*}{\\partial x^2} + V\\psi^*.\\] Using this we can rewrite the integrand as . \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} |\\psi|^2 = \\frac{-i\\hbar}{2m}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi^*}{\\partial x^2}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg).\\] Let’s add and subtract \\((\\partial\\psi^*/\\partial_x)(\\partial\\psi/\\partial_x)\\) so that the right hand side becomes . \\[\\frac{-i\\hbar}{2m}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi^*}{\\partial x^2}\\psi + \\frac{\\partial\\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial\\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x} - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg).\\] Now it’s easy to see that we can factor out a partial derivative with respect to \\(x\\) . \\[\\frac{-i\\hbar}{2m}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial\\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg).\\] Therefore, the integral is simply evaluated as . \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}|\\psi|^2 dx = \\frac{-i\\hbar}{2m}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial\\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg)\\bigg|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}.\\] The wave function \\(\\psi(x, t)\\) should approach zero in the limit \\(x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty\\) in order to be square integrable and normalizable. As a result, the right hand side amounts to zero. Therefore, the time derivative of the norm is zero, . \\[\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\psi|^2 dx = 0,\\] which means that if the wave function is normalized, it stays normalized as it evolves via the Schrodinger equation. | Of course we are assuming that the wave function is not being measured as it evolves. &#8617; . | .
