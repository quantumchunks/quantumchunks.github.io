Itâ€™s a way of distinguishing a column vector \\(|v\\rangle\\) (ket) from its dual row vector \\(\\langle v|\\) (called bra). The state of the qubit, \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\), can be explicitly written as a two component column vector . \\[|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\] where \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) are complex numbers. The qubit can also be represented by its dual row vector . \\[\\langle\\psi| = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1^* &amp; c_2^* \\end{pmatrix}\\] These two representation are considered equal. ",

    "content": "Now, the elements of the state vector \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) cannot be any numbers as they are limited by the normalization condition. It is a postulate of quantum mechanics that the state of a qubit is normalized which means the magnitude of the state vector is unity. By definition the magnitude (or norm) of a complex vector \\(\\|\\psi\\|\\) is equal to the square root of its inner product with its dual row vector. \\[\\|\\psi\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle \\psi | \\cdot | \\psi \\rangle}\\] The inner product \\(\\langle \\psi | \\cdot | \\psi \\rangle\\) is often abbreviated as \\(\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle\\). It is worth mentioning that the inner product is always defined between a bra and a ket. Hence, called bracket. We can write the inner product explicitly in terms of \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) . \\[\\langle \\psi | \\psi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1^* &amp; c_2^* \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix} = |c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2.\\] Again, the normalization dictates that \\(\\sqrt{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle}=1\\). In other words . \\[\\sqrt{|c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2} = 1.\\] ",
