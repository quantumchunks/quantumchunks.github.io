    "content": "How do we know if the wave function stays normalized as it evolves in time? 1 . Solution The answer is in the Schrodinger equation which describes the time evolution of the wave function. Assume a particle with the wave function \\(\\psi(x, t)\\) in a one-dimensional world with potential energy \\(V(x)\\). The Schrodinger equation for this particle is . \\[i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2} + V\\psi.\\] Now, let’s see what happens if we take the total derivative of the norm of the wave function \\(\\int\\vert\\psi\\vert^2 dx\\) with respect to time which is equivalent to . \\[\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\psi|^2 dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}|\\psi(x, t)|^2 dx.\\] Since \\(\\vert\\psi\\vert^2 = \\psi^*\\psi\\), we can use the product rule to write the integrand as . \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} |\\psi|^2 = \\frac{\\partial\\psi^*}{\\partial t}\\psi + \\psi^* \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial t}.\\] From the Schrodinger equation and its complex conjugate we know . \\[i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2} + V\\psi,\\] \\[-i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi^*}{\\partial x^2} + V\\psi^*.\\] Using this we can rewrite the integrand as . \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} |\\psi|^2 = \\frac{-i\\hbar}{2m}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi^*}{\\partial x^2}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg)\\] \\[= \\frac{-i\\hbar}{2m}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial\\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg).\\] Therefore, the integral is reduced to . \\[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}|\\psi|^2 dx = \\frac{-i\\hbar}{2m}\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial\\psi^*}{\\partial x}\\psi - \\psi^*\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial x}\\bigg)\\bigg|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}.\\] The wave function \\(\\psi(x, t)\\) should approach zero in the limit \\(x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty\\) in order to be square integrable and normalizable. Therefore, the right hand side amounts to zero. Therefore, the time derivative of the norm is zero, . \\[\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\psi|^2 dx = 0,\\] which means that the Schrodinger equation keeps the wave function normalized. | Of course we are assuming that the wave function is not being measured as it evolves. &#8617; . | .

To multiply a complex number by a real number \\(r\\), you would just multiply each part by \\(r\\) . \\[rz = ra + irb\\] Negation . The negative of a complex number is obtained by multiplying it by \\(-1\\) that is negating the real and imaginary parts individually. \\[-z = -a - ib\\] Subtraction .

We can actually figure out the rules of multiplying two complex numbers on our own if we use the real-imaginary representation.

Conjugation is a fancy name for when you negate the imaginary part of a complex number, that is you multiply the imaginary part by \\(-1\\). To show that a complex number is conjugated you would add an asterisk on the top right corner of the symbol. \\[z = a + ib \\rightarrow z^* = a - ib\\] As a result, if you conjugate a complex number twice you will get the original number . \\[(z^*)^* = z\\] ",

That won’t change the ratio . \\[\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{z_1z_2^*}{z_2z_2^*}.\\] Notice that the denominator is just a real number \\(z_2z_2^* = |z_2|^2 = c^2 + d^2\\). So dividing by \\(|z_2|^2\\) is just like a scalar multiplication by \\(1/|z_2|^2\\). Therefore, we just need to calculate \\(z_1z_2^*\\). \\[z_1z_2^* = (ac + bd) + i(-ad + bc)\\] Finally, rescaling this by \\(1/(c^2 + d^2)\\) leads us to the final expression for division . \\[\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{1}{c^2 + d^2} [(ac + bd) + i(-ad + bc)]\\] ",
