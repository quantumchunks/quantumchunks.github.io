After all, theories are made up by other people like you and me. Quantum computing is even simpler to grasp. You do not need the whole framework of quantum mechanics to understand quantum computing. Even if you’re in high school you can learn quantum computing. You just need the right mathematics. Basics of Complex numbers, linear algebra (matrices and vectors), and probability theory are enough to get started. The more mathematics you know the easier it gets. ",

Adding two complex numbers is straightforward. Just add the real parts together and add the imaginary parts together. \\[z_1 = a + ib \\\\ z_2 = c + id \\\\ z_1 + z_2 = (a + c) + i(b + d)\\] Real multiplication . To multiply a complex number by a real number \\(r\\), you would just multiply each part by \\(r\\) . \\[rz = ra + irb\\] Negation . The negative of a complex number is obtained by multiplying it by \\(-1\\) that is negating the real and imaginary parts individually. \\[-z = -a - ib\\] Subtraction . Subtracting two complex numbers \\(z_1 - z_2\\) is equal to adding the first one to the negative of the second one \\(z_1 + (-z_2)\\). \\[z_1 - z_2 = (a - c) + i(b - d)\\] Complex Multiplication . We can actually figure out the rules of multiplying two complex numbers on our own if we use the real-imaginary representation. Assume we have two complex numbers \\(z_1 = a + ib\\) and \\(z_2 = c + id\\). Let’s multiply these two numbers the same way we do for unknown variables in normal algebra, that is . \\[z_1 z_2 = (a + ib)(c + id) = ac + iad + ibc + i^2bd\\] From the definition of imaginary unit \\(i = \\sqrt{-1}\\) you can see that \\(i^2\\) is simply equal to \\(-1\\) which is a real number! Now let’s bundle up the real parts together and the imaginary parts together and come up with a more compact expression for multiplication . \\[z_1 z_2 = (ac - bd) + i(ad + bc)\\] Conjugation . Conjugation is a fancy name for when you negate the imaginary part of a complex number, that is you multiply the imaginary part by \\(-1\\). To show that a complex number is conjugated you would add an asterisk on the top right corner of the symbol. \\[z = a + ib \\rightarrow z^* = a - ib\\] As a result, if you conjugate a complex number twice you will get the original number . \\[(z^*)^* = z\\] ",

Same is true for qubits which are quantum mechanical objects. You can’t determine the exact state of any arbitrary qubit. But, you can describe the state of a qubit probabilistically and measure the qubit and get a value as a result. However, this does not guarantee that if you prepare the same qubit and measure it again, the result would be the same.
