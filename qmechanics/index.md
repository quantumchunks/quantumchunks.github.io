## Wave function 
What the heck is a wave function?  
The wave function contains all the _information_ about a particle or an object. 
It is usually denoted by $$\psi$$ and is typically a function of position and time $$\psi(x, t)$$. 
It could also depend on other variables such as discrete values for quantum mechanical quantities such as spin, angular momentum, etc. 
Here are two examples of the information you can get from a wave function. 
- $$|\psi(x, t)|^2$$ is the probability density of finding the particle at point $$x$$ at time $$t$$.
This is known as Born's rule. 
- $$\psi^*(x, t)\partial_x\psi(x, t)$$ is the density of the momentum of the particle at point $$x$$ at time $$t$$. 
If you integrate it over space ($$x$$) you will get the average momentum of the particle at time $$t$$.  

Quantum mechanics can only offer statistical information. 
There is an inherent uncertainty in the theory about how much we **_can_** know about a particle. 

## Two kinds of physical processes 
1. evolution: wave function evolves according to Schrodinger equation 
2. measurement: wave function collapses suddenly and discontinuously to a spike at a specific point in space-time.
