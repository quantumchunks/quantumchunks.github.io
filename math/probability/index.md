# Probability Theory
Quantum theory has a probabilistic interpretation. 
There is an inherent uncertainty in determining physical quantities in quantum mechanics. 
For example, you can't determine the position and velocity of an electron simultaneously. 
It's just a direct consequence of the math that is used in quantum mechanics. 
Same is true for qubits which are quantum mechanical objects. 
You can't determine the exact state of any arbitrary qubit.
But, you _can_ describe the state of a qubit probabilistically and measure the qubit and get a value as a result. 
However, this does not guarantee that if you prepare the same qubit and measure it again, the result would be the same. 
The point I'm trying to make is that probability theory is necessary in understanding how a quantum object behaves or a quantum computer operates.  

Here, you will learn the basics of probability theory. 

## Sample space 
The sample space contains all the possible outcomes of a random experiment (such as tossing coins, rolling dice, or measuring qubits).
